                    <p>
                        I've worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Ruby over the years. 
                        In addition, I have some experience working in an AWS environment and WordPress. 
                        The image above is a previous version of my portfolio website that I designed.

                    <p>
                        When working with animation, 
                        I use Procreate on the iPad to sketch out ideas and apply traditional animation concepts to 3D animation.
                        I use Maya to do modeling, UV and texture mapping, rigging, and animation.

                    <h2>Illustration</h2>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy drawing as a hobby.
                        The above painting was a result from my boyfriend asking me to color in his sketch for him.
                        Despite my personal art style being wildly different from his, 
                        I was glad to be able to apply my intuition with colors to his drawing.

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>
                        I use Logic Pro to compose electronic music. Over the course of Fall 2021, 
                        I learned to do sequencing, sound synthesis, sampling, and mixing. 
                        Prior to using Logic Pro, I would create music on my iPad using MIDI.
                        I've also been playing the violin in orchestras for over ten years.

                    <p>
                        Although I used to do a lot of face retouching before college, 
                        I now focus more on color correction. 
                        I took the above photograph in 2014 and edited it in 2019.
